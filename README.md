# The Vichalana Anomaly Benchmark
This repository contains a time-series, multivariate dataset with a benchmark which can be used in performance anomaly detection in API Gateways. 
Vichalana Anomaly Benchmark can be used for evaluating anomaly detection algorithms. It comprises with 25 features and total of 
~50,000 datapoints. This dataset is synthetically generated using a industry standard setup of API Gateway.

## Scoreboard
The Vichalana Anomaly Benchmark scores are normalized in such a way that the score for perfect detctor is 100.0 and the score for null detector is 0.0
